##

<div>1. If you want to use Segment Anything on a local machine, make sure to Create a new environment and install some required libraries such as python>=3.8, pytorch>=1.7, and torchvision>=0.8, Or you can use the Google Colab to run the code. Here we will be using a Colab notebook for the example.</div>div>

##

<div>2. In the Colab notebook, ensure you have access to a GPU for faster processing.</div>

##

<div>3. Clone the repository and install.</div>

##

<div>4. Import required libraries.</div>

##

<div>5. Upload a zip file in Colab content dir and unzip the files using the local zip.</div>

##

<div>6. Store the Image paths in a list.</div>

##

<div>7. Plot Annotation.</div>

##

<div>8. Read images to plot and analysis of images.</div>
